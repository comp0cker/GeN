## Notes

Notes can be inputted by typing the capital letter of the note. Any amount of sharps/flats is fine (currently a problem with recognizing some enharmonics, however). Seperate notes are notated with spaces, and multiple motes played together are notated by the lack of a space

For example, GeN could play the first bar of Fur Elise by inputting the following:

```
E D# E D# B D C AC
```

## Chords

### Absolute

Chords can be notated by doing the method above, or for a far easier approach, by using any common short hand notation for a given chord. Examples include M, maj, m, min, 7, 9, maj9, aug7, 11, sus4, etc. All supported chord inputs are on the [mingus documentation here](http://something). Here's a simple chord progression in GeN:

```
CM E7 Am DM G7 C6
```
